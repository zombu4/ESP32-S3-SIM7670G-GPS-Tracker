## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-25 - üéØ GPS PORT SWITCHING FIX

### Fixed
- **GPS Initialization Error**: Removed undocumented `AT+CGNSSPORTSWITCH` command that was causing GPS initialization failures
- **GPS Power On**: Now using Waveshare official method with only `AT+CGNSSPWR=1` and `AT+CGNSSTST=1`
- **Port Switching Issues**: Eliminated all port switching commands per Waveshare documentation
- **System Stability**: No more GPS-related errors during initialization sequence

### Changed  
- `modem_init.c`: Removed problematic `AT+CGNSSPORTSWITCH=0,1` command from GPS initialization
- `gps_module.c`: Removed port switching commands from power on/off functions
- `lte_module.c`: Cleaned up GPS interference prevention code
- Updated all comments to reflect Waveshare official approach

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: `AT+CGNSSPORTSWITCH` command not documented in official Waveshare ESP32-S3-SIM7670G reference
- **Solution**: Follow Waveshare documentation exactly - use only documented GNSS commands
- **Result**: GPS initialization now works perfectly with `AT+CGNSSPWR=1` ‚Üí `OK` (343ms response)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ GPS ready for outdoor satellite acquisition testing
